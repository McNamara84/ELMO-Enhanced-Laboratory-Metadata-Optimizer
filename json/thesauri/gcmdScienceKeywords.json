This is accomplished by applying different types of silvicultural treatments such as thinning, harvesting, planting, pruning, prescribed burning and site preparation. Intermediate treatments (thinning) are designed to enhance growth, quality, vigor, and composition of the stand after establishment or regeneration and prior to final harvest. Regeneration treatments (harvesting) are applied to mature stands in order to establish a new age class of trees. Regeneration methods are grouped into four categories: coppice, even-aged, two-aged, and uneven-aged.\n\nAll vegetation activities, including prescribed fire, wildlife habitat improvement, timber harvesting and cutting trees in campgrounds for human safety must have a silvicultural prescription. A silvicultural prescription is a document which has a planned series of treatments designed to change current stand structure and composition of a stand to one that meets management goals. The prescription normally considers ecological, economic, and societal objectives and constraints. In the Forest Service, silvicultural prescriptions are prepared or reviewed by a certified silviculturist prior to implementing the project or treatment.",

In the troposphere ammonia reacts rapidly with acids such as sulfuric (H2SO4), nitric (HNO3) to form fine particulate matter (PM2.5) [Malm et al., 2004]. These ammonium (NH4+) containing aerosols affect Earth's radiative balance, both directly by scattering incoming radiation [Adams et al., 2001; Martin et al., 2004; Henze et al., 2012] and indirectly as cloud condensation nuclei [Abbatt et al., 2006]. PM2.5 endangers public health by penetrating the human respiratory systems, depositing in the lungs and alveolar regions [Pope et al., 2002], and causing premature mortality [Lelieveld et al., 2015]. A precursor of these inorganic aerosols, gaseous NH3 is often the limiting species in their formation [Wang et al., 2013; Lelieveld et al., 2015]. Excess reactive nitrogen reduces biodiversity and causes harmful algal blooms and anoxic conditions. Dry deposition of gaseous ammonia may have substantially greater adverse impacts on ecosystem health than deposition of ammonium in aerosols or precipitation [Sheppard et al., 2011]. In contrast, PM2.5 has greater impact on human morbidity and mortality. In this article we quantify recent (~14\u2009year) increases in tropospheric ammonia and suggest likely causes for these trends.",

Chemically, black carbon (BC) is a component of fine particulate matter (PM \u2264 2.5 \u00b5m in aerodynamic diameter). Black carbon consists of pure carbon in several linked forms. It is formed through the incomplete combustion of fossil fuels, biofuel, and biomass, and is one of the main types of particle in both anthropogenic and naturally occurring soot. Black carbon causes human morbidity and premature mortality. Because of these human health impacts, many countries have worked to reduce their emissions, making it an easy pollutant to abate in anthropogenic sources.",

Sea salt aerosols are characterized as non-light-absorbing, highly hygroscopic, and having coarse particle size. Some sea salt dominated aerosols could have a single scattering albedo as large as ~0.97. Due to the hygroscopy, a sea salt particle can serve as a very efficient cloud condensation nuclei (CCN), altering cloud reflectivity, lifetime, and precipitation process. According to the IPCC report, the total sea salt flux from ocean to atmosphere is ~3300 Tg/yr",

It usually occurs in combination\r\nwith plant sugars. The tuberous edible plant of the spurge family called\r\ncassava (also known as manioc, mandioc, or yuca) was used by primitive peoples\r\nto produce HCN for poison darts and arrows. HCN is produced by other plants,\r\nbacteria and fungi. Emissions from CN radicals are occasionally observed from\r\nlightning disturbed air. Hydrogen cyanide is produced by biomass burning since\r\nnitrogen in plant material is mostly present as amino acids and upon combustion\nthis nitrogen is emitted as a variety of compounds including NH3, NO, NO2, N2O,\norganic nitriles and nitrates. It is interesting to note that the atmospheric\r\nmeasurements of HCN reported by Zander et al. (1988) gave a mixing ratio for\r\nHCN in the Southern Hemisphere which was approximately 5% higher than that for\r\nthe Northern Hemisphere. This may be due to biomass burning.\r\nThere are many anthropogenic sources of compounds containing CN which can be\r\nreleased into the atmosphere. Cyanides are used in a variety of chemical\r\nprocesses including fumigation, case hardening of iron and steel,\r\nelectroplating and in the concentration of ores. Hydrogen cyanide is used to\r\nprepare polyacrylonitrile fibres (known by the generic name of acrylic)\r\nsynthetic rubber, plastics, and in gas masers to produce a wavelength of 3.34\r\nmm. Hydrogen cyanide is a combustion product which is a human hazard during\r\ndomestic and industrial fires and from tobacco smoking. Some catalytic\r\nconverters in bad repair can produce large amounts of Hydrogen cyanide.\r\nHydrogen cyanide is produced in large quantities for laboratory and commercial\r\nuse by three principle methods: Treatment of sodium cyanide with sulphuric\r\nacid, catalytic oxidation of a methane-ammonia mixture, and decomposition of\r\nformamide (HCONH2).",

On an atom-for-atom basis, stratospheric bromine is more efficient at destroying ozone than is chlorine because the HBr reservoir species is more photochemically active than HCl; however, there is much less of hydrogen bromide in the stratosphere. Recent data suggest that since 1998 atmospheric concentrations have dropped 13% due the CH3Br use limitations mandated by the Montreal Protocol",

In addition to saving the CO2 emissions (if the H2 is formed from carbon-free energy sources), also the massive energy-related emissions of other compounds like carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides and soot could be drastically reduced, leading to improvements in air quality (Schultz et al., 2003). Nevertheless, unavoidable leakage in the production, distribution, storage and consumption of H2 could drastically alter the mixing ratio of H2 in the atmosphere. Although it is not a greenhouse gas itself, H2 affects the atmospheric lifetime of the greenhouse gas methane and many other species via its reaction with the hydroxyl (OH) radical (Schultz et al.,2003). In addition, H2 is an important source for stratospheric water vapor, which provides the substrate for polar stratospheric clouds that play a key role in the formation of the stratospheric polar ozone hole. Therefore, increasing levels of H2 in the atmosphere will counteract the predicted recovery of the ozone hole (Tromp et al., 2003; Warwick et al.,2004; Feck et al., 2008).",

High ground-level ozone amounts contribute to poor air quality, adversely affecting human health, agricultural productivity, and forested ecosystems. Ozone absorbs infrared radiation, and is most potent as a greenhouse gas in the cold upper troposphere located 8\u201315 km above the surface. In the stratosphere, between approximately 15 and 50 km above the Earth\u2019s surface, a layer rich in ozone serves as a \u201csunscreen\u201d for the world by shielding the Earth\u2019s surface from harmful ultraviolet radiation. This absorption of solar energy also affects atmospheric circulation patterns and thus influences weather around the globe. Moreover, throughout the atmosphere, ozone is the key ingredient that initiates chemical cleansing of the atmosphere of various pollutants, such as carbon monoxide and methane, among others, which could otherwise accumulate to harmful levels or exert a stronger influence on climate. Therefore, changes to ozone anywhere in the atmosphere can have major impacts on the Earth.",

Colliding drops having negligible impact energy compared to their surface energy behave as water spheres that collide with a collision efficiency (the fraction of small drops that collide with a large drop within the geometric collision cross section) predicted by the theory for falling spheres. The result of increasing impact energy is to flatten the colliding drops at the point of impact, impeding the drainage of the air and delaying contact between them. As the distortion relaxes, the drops rebound, reducing the coalescence efficiency for cloud drops and drizzle drops colliding with smaller drops. At larger impact energy, separation will occur if the rotational energy (fixed by conservation of angular momentum) is higher than the surface energy of the coalescing drops. This phenomenon, termed temporary coalescence, can result in satellite droplets considerably smaller than either of the parent drops. This phenomenon is also called partial coalescence because the large drop may gain mass as a result of the higher internal pressure in the small drop. At still larger impact energy, drop breakup occurs for the smaller drop. About 20% of the high-energy collisions between large raindrops (d > 3 mm) and drizzle drops (d > 0.2 mm) result in the disintegration of both drops. Other factors that affect coalescence are electric charge and electric field, both of which promote coalescence, leading to earlier onset of coalescence during an interaction so that coalescence efficiencies are increased by suppression of rebound and temporary coalescence. All of these processes are important in formation of precipitation in all liquid clouds both above and below 0\u00b0C.",

It is sufficiently cold for noctilucent ('night shining') clouds to form in summer, at altitudes around 83 km. \n\nNoctilucent clouds can only be seen when the sun is shining on them (at ~83 km) and not on the lower atmosphere, i.e. when the sun is between 6 and 16 degrees below the horizon.\n\nThey are a summer, polar phenomena but because of the restrictive viewing conditions they are most commonly observed at latitudes between 55 and 65 degrees. \n\nNoctilucent clouds were first reported in 1885 when they were independently observed in Germany and Russia. This was two years after the volcanic explosion of Krakatoa in the Straits of Java.\n\nOne hypothesis is that the initial observation of noctilucent clouds was related to an increase in the number of observers of the twilight skies attracted by the spectacular displays resulting from the globally distributed volcanic debris of Krakatoa. Alternatively, water vapour injected into the upper atmosphere by the volcano ultimately reached the cold, dry upper mesophere.\n\nSubsequent observations have proved that noctilucent clouds are not solely related to volcanic activity, and their volcanic association is now scientifically contentious. It has been alternatively claimed that the appearance of noctilucent clouds is the earliest evidence of anthropogenic climate change.\n\nNoctilucent cloud observations from north-west Europe over the last 30 years show an increasing trend in the number of nights on which the clouds are observed each summer season, superimposed on a decadal variability that appears to be solar-cycle related.\n\nCompeting anthropogenic explanations for this increasing occurrence of noctilucent clouds focus on either excessive greenhouse cooling of the middle atmosphere or increased water vapour linked to increased methane release associated principally with intensive farming activities.\n\nThey have been observed thousands of times in the northern hemisphere, but less than 100 observations have been reported from the southern hemisphere. It has not been resolved if this is due to inter-hemispheric differences (temperature &/or water vapour) in the atmosphere at these altitudes, or the lack of observers and poorer observing conditions in southern latitudes.",

PSCs provide surfaces upon which heterogeneous chemical reactions take place. These reactions lead to the production of free radicals of chlorine in the stratosphere which directly destroy ozone molecules.\n\nPSCs form poleward of about 60\u00baS latitude in the altitude range 10 km to 25 km during the winter and early spring. The clouds are classified into Types I and II according to their particle size and formation temperature.\n\nType II clouds, also known as nacreous or mother-of-pearl clouds, are composed of ice crystals and form when temperatures are below the ice frost point (typically below -83\u00baC).\n\nThe Type I PSCs are optically much thinner than the Type II clouds, and have a formation threshold temperature 5 to 8\u00baC above the frost point. These clouds consist mainly of hydrated droplets of nitric acid and sulphuric acid.\n\nDespite two decades of research, the climatology of PSCs is not well described, and this impacts on the accuracy of ozone depletion models. The timing and duration of PSC events, their geographic extent and vertical distributions, and their annual variability are not well understood.The Davis lidar has been used to study stratospheric clouds since 2001. The observations consist of profiles of Rayeligh laser backscatter at a wavelength of 532 nm as a function of altitude. The measurements are being used to investigate the climatology of the clouds and their relation to the temperature structure of the stratosphere, and the influence of atmospheric gravity waves and planetary waves in modulating their structure and ozone depletion.",

It can be most confusing near sea coasts with cold coastal water. It can be difficult at times to differentiate between this and other types of fog, especially since nighttime cooling intensifies all fogs.

Fog formed when water vapor is added to air that is much colder than the vapor's source; most commonly, when very cold air drifts across relatively warm water.\n\nNo matter what the nature of the vapor source (warm water, industrial combustion exhaust, exhaled breath), its equilibrium vapor pressure is greater than that corresponding to the colder air; thus, the water vapor, upon becoming mixed with and cooled by the cold air, rapidly condenses. It should be noted that this mechanism never allows the fog to actually reach the vapor source. Also, upon further mixing in sufficiently turbulent or convective flow (only a slight degree is needed), the fog particles evaporate at a more or less well defined upper limit of the fog. Note, also, that although advection of air is necessary to produce steam fog, it differs greatly from an advection fog in the usual sense, which is caused by warm, moist air moving over a cold surface. Steam fog is commonly observed over lakes and streams on cold autumn mornings as well as in polar regions. It is sometimes confused with ice fog, but its particles are entirely liquid. At temperatures below -29\u00b0C (-20\u00b0F), these may freeze into droxtals and create a type of ice fog that may be known as frost smoke.",

The cumuliform cloud elements generally have a common base and usually seem to be arranged in lines. The species is found only in the genera cirrus, cirrocumulus, altocumulus, and stratocumulus. Cirrus castellanus differs from cirrocumulus castellanus in that its vertical protuberances subtend an angle of more than 1\u00b0 when observed at an angle of more than 30\u00b0 above the horizon. When altocumulus castellanus and stratocumulus castellanus attain a considerable vertical development, they become cumulus congestus and often develop into cumulonimbus.

The cumuliform cloud elements generally have a common base and usually seem to be arranged in lines. The species is found only in the genera cirrus, cirrocumulus, altocumulus, and stratocumulus. Cirrus castellanus differs from cirrocumulus castellanus in that its vertical protuberances subtend an angle of more than 1\u00b0 when observed at an angle of more than 30\u00b0 above the horizon. When altocumulus castellanus and stratocumulus castellanus attain a considerable vertical development, they become cumulus congestus and often develop into cumulonimbus.

This species is found mainly in the genera cirrocumulus, altocumulus, and (rarely) stratocumulus. Altocumulus lenticularis differs from cirrocumulus lenticularis in that, when smooth and without elements, it has shadowed parts while the latter is very white throughout.

To be a heat wave such a period should last at least one day, but conventionally it lasts from several days to several weeks. In 1900, A. T. Burrows more rigidly defined a \"hot wave\" as a spell of three or more days on each of which the maximum shade temperature reaches or exceeds 90\u00b0F. More realistically, the comfort criteria for any one region are dependent upon the normal conditions of that region. In the eastern United States, heat waves generally build up with southerly winds on the western flank of an anticyclone centered over the southeastern states, the air being warmed by passage over a land surface heated by the sun.",

Even in Europe the prevailing west to northwest winds of summer have been called the \"European monsoon.\" The primary cause is the much greater annual variation of temperature over large land areas compared with neighboring ocean surfaces, causing an excess of pressure over the continents in winter and a deficit in summer, but other factors such as the relief features of the land have a considerable effect. The monsoons are strongest on the southern and eastern sides of Asia, the largest landmass, but monsoons also occur on the coasts of tropical regions wherever the planetary circulation is not strong enough to inhibit them. They have been described in Spain, northern Australia, Africa except the Mediterranean, Texas, and the western coasts of the United States and Chile. In India the term is popularly applied chiefly to the southwest monsoon and, by extension, to the rains which it brings.",

Earlier definitions also included a condition of low temperatures, on the order of -7\u00b0C (20\u00b0F) or lower, or -12\u00b0C (10\u00b0F) or lower (severe blizzard). The name originated in the United States but it is also used in other countries. In the Antarctic the name is given to violent autumnal winds off the ice cap. In southeastern France, the cold north wind with snow is termed blizzard (see also boulbie).\nSimilar storms in Russian Asia are the buran and purga. In popular usage in the United States and in England, the term is often used for any heavy snowstorm accompanied by strong winds.",

It shows up as a red upside down triangle on the Storm Relative Velocity Display. Existence of a TVS strongly increases the probability of tornado occurrence, but does not guarantee it; therefore, the feature triggering it must be examined closely by the radar operator.

They are present in all groups of organisms, i.e., bacteria, fungi, plants and animals, and play a key role in the maintenance of the proper structure and functioning of biological membranes. The desaturases are characterized by the presence of three conserved histidine tracks which are presumed to compose the Fe-binding active centers of the enzymes. Recent findings on the structure and expression of different types of fatty acid desaturase in cyanobacteria, plants and animals are reviewed in this article. Roles of individual desaturases in temperature acclimation and principles of regulation of the desaturase genes are discussed.",

Ecological stoichiometry1,2 provides an integrative approach for such analyses, as all organisms are composed of the same major elements (C, N, P) whose balance affects production, nutrient cycling, and food-web dynamics3,4. Here we show both similarities and differences in the C:N:P ratios of primary producers (autotrophs) and invertebrate primary consumers (herbivores) across habitats. Terrestrial food webs are built on an extremely nutrient-poor autotroph base with C:P and C:N ratios higher than in lake particulate matter, although the N:P ratios are nearly identical. Terrestrial herbivores (insects) and their freshwater counterparts (zooplankton) are nutrient-rich and indistinguishable in C:N:P stoichiometry. In both lakes and terrestrial systems, herbivores should have low growth efficiencies (10\u201330%) when consuming autotrophs with typical carbon-to-nutrient ratios. These stoichiometric constraints on herbivore growth appear to be qualitatively similar and widespread in both environments.",

Studies conducted mainly in vertebrates have demonstrated that LC-PUFA can be biosynthesized through the concerted action of two sets of enzymes, namely fatty acyl desaturases (Fads) and elongation of very long-chain fatty acid (Elovl) proteins. While LC-PUFA research is a thriving field, mainly focused on human health, an integrated view regarding the evolution of LC-PUFA biosynthetic genetic machinery in chordates is yet to be produced. Particularly important is to understand whether lineage specific life history trajectories, as well as major biological transitions, or particular genomic processes such as genome duplications have impacted the evolution of LC-PUFA biosynthetic pathways. Here we review the gene repertoire of Fads and Elovl in chordate genomes and the diversity of substrate specificities acquired during evolution. We take advantage of the magnitude of genomic and functional data to show that combination duplication processes and functional plasticity have generated a wide diversity of physiological capacities in extant lineages. A clear evolutionary framework is provided, which will be instrumental for the full clarification of functional capacities between the various vertebrate groups",

This chapter focuses on patterns of convergent evolution of traits to assess which features represent unique desert adaptations. There are several taxa for which suitable, phylogenetically-controlled analyses have been conducted. This means that the effects of phylogeny, which may be considerable, have been removed. Removing the effects of phylogeny allow one to test whether an adaptation has occurred. For example, a character may be considered a desert adaptation because many desert-dwelling species possess the character, and non-desert-dwelling species do not. However, if there are many desert-dwelling species in a particular part of a clade, then this character may have evolved by chance alone. Select examples from tenebrionid beetles, lizards, birds, and mammals are considered.",

It was first applied to the winds over the Arabian Sea, which blow for six months from northeast and for six months from southwest, but it has been extended to similar winds in other parts of the world. Even in Europe the prevailing west to northwest winds of summer have been called the \"European monsoon.\" The primary cause is the much greater annual variation of temperature over large land areas compared with neighboring ocean surfaces, causing an excess of pressure over the continents in winter and a deficit in summer, but other factors such as the relief features of the land have a considerable effect. The monsoons are strongest on the southern and eastern sides of Asia, the largest landmass, but monsoons also occur on the coasts of tropical regions wherever the planetary circulation is not strong enough to inhibit them. They have been described in Spain, northern Australia, Africa except the Mediterranean, Texas, and the western coasts of the United States and Chile. In India the term is popularly applied chiefly to the southwest monsoon and, by extension, to the rains which it brings.",

The CUI is a measure of the volume of water that upwells along the coast; it identifies the amount of offshore transport of surface waters due to geostrophic wind fields. Indices are in units of cubic meters per second along each 100 meters of coastline. Positive numbers indicate offshore transport for the upwelling index product and southward transport for the along-shore product. The CUI was developed by Dr. Andrew Bakun (Bakun 1973) and is provided by the Pacific Fisheries Environmental Lab (PFEL) of NOAA National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS).",

Areas were selected that represent the Maritime Continent (MC) (10\u00b0 N \u2013 10\u00b0S; 90\u00b0 E \u2013 150\u00b0 E) and central to eastern Pacific (P) (10\u00b0 N \u2013 10\u00b0 S; 160\u00b0 E \u2013 100\u00b0 W). These regions capture the largest precipitation anomalies associated with the interannual variations of the Walker circulation and contain the largest correlations between GPCP and Nino 3.4 and SOI. Within P and MC the absolute magnitude of the largest correlation is over +0.6. \n\nBecause of the spatially varying nature of rainfall, it was decided to use a moving block average which would capture the strongest zonal gradients within the equatorial Pacific. This procedure is unlike many fixed area average indices, and allows for a realistic meridional component of the precipitation gradient and migration of the ascending and descending branches of the Walker circulation.",

The purpose is to assign a single\r\nnumeric value to the precipitation which can be compared across\r\nregions with markedly different climates. Technically, the SPI is the\r\nnumber of standard deviations that the observed value would deviate\r\nfrom the long-term mean, for a normally distributed random\r\nvariable. Since precipitation is not normally distributed, a\r\ntransformation is first applied so that the transformed precipitation\r\nvalues follow a normal distribution.\r\nThe Standardized Precipitation Index was designed to explicitly\r\nexpress the fact that it is possible to simultaneously experience wet\r\nconditions on one or more time scales, and dry conditions at other\r\ntime scales, often a difficult concept to convey in simple terms to\r\ndecision-makers. Consequently, a separate SPI value is calculated for\r\na selection of time scales, covering the last 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8,\r\n9, 10, 11, 12, 15, 18, 24, 30, 36, 48, 60, and 72 months, and ending\r\non the last day of the latest month.",

However, the causes of its occasional reversal between early and late winter remain unclear. This study proposes a mechanism for the mid-winter reversal of NAO from the perspective of local midlatitude air-sea interaction. Strong sea surface temperature (SST) tripole events, which are defined by empirical orthogonal function of winter-mean interannual North Atlantic SST anomalies, are primarily induced by NAO in early winter and peak in January. In late winter, the persistent SST tripole exerts active feedback on atmosphere through diabatic heat and transient eddy forcing. The resulting atmospheric circulation anomalies exhibit an almost reversed NAO pattern in February, which forms a wavetrain originating above the Gulf Stream and propagating to the Middle East and weakens the former SST tripole. Consequently, significant reversals of air temperature anomalies occur in Europe and the Caspian Sea area between February and December.",

However, the causes of its occasional reversal between early and late winter remain unclear. This study proposes a mechanism for the mid-winter reversal of NAO from the perspective of local midlatitude air-sea interaction. Strong sea surface temperature (SST) tripole events, which are defined by empirical orthogonal function of winter-mean interannual North Atlantic SST anomalies, are primarily induced by NAO in early winter and peak in January. In late winter, the persistent SST tripole exerts active feedback on atmosphere through diabatic heat and transient eddy forcing. The resulting atmospheric circulation anomalies exhibit an almost reversed NAO pattern in February, which forms a wavetrain originating above the Gulf Stream and propagating to the Middle East and weakens the former SST tripole. Consequently, significant reversals of air temperature anomalies occur in Europe and the Caspian Sea area between February and December.",

To define the spatial pattern, data are defined over the region (21S-32N, 74W-15E), and spatially smoothed (three longitude by two latitude points). The seasonal cycle is removed, data are detrended, a three-month running mean is applied to the data, and the linear fit to the Cold Tongue Index (a measure of ENSO variability) is subtracted from each spatial point. Spatial patterns are defined as the first left (SST) and right (winds) maps resulting from singular value decomposition of the covariance matrix between the two fields. The AMM time series below is calculated via projecting SST or the 10m wind field (detrended, CTI removed, but no 3-month running mean) onto the spatial structure resulting from the MCA above.\nTime Interval: Monthly\nTime Coverage: 1948 to present",

Nino 3.4 has traditionally been used as a measure of ENSO strength in the tropical Pacific. However, it's use alone neglects explicit atmospheric processes. By adding the SOI or Southern Oscillation Index (the pressure difference between Tahiti and Darwin), these processes are more directly included. In addition, older SST values are at least partially reconstructed and not explicitly measured. By including the SOI, which is better measured historically, the effect of biases in the SST data introduced by the reconstruction technique are reduced. A more detailed explanation how the index was created is available (http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/people/cathy.smith/best/details.html).",

A positive phase of the EA-Jet pattern reflects an intensification of westerlies over the central latitudes of the eastern North Atlantic and over much of Europe, while a negative phase reflects a strong split-flow configuration over these regions, sometimes in association with long-lived blocking anticyclones in the vicinity of Greenland and Great Britain.",

                                                    "description": "The East Atlantic (EA) pattern is the second prominent mode of low-frequency variability over the North Atlantic, and appears as a leading mode in all months. The EA pattern is structurally similar to the NAO, and consists of a north-south dipole of anomaly centers spanning the North Atlantic from east to west. The anomaly centers of the EA pattern are displaced southeastward to the approximate nodal lines of the NAO pattern. For this reason, the EA pattern is often interpreted as a \u201csouthward shifted\u201d NAO pattern. However, the lower-latitude center contains a strong subtropical link in association with modulations in the subtropical ridge intensity and location. This subtropical link makes the EA pattern distinct from its NAO counterpart. This EA pattern is similar to that shown in the Barnston and Livezey (1987) study, but is distinctly different from the EA pattern originally defined by Wallace and Gutzler (1981).\n\nThe positive phase of the EA pattern is associated with above-average surface temperatures in Europe in all months, and with below-average temperatures over the southern U.S. during January-May and in the north-central U.S. during July-October. It is also associated with above-average precipitation over northern Europe and Scandinavia, and with below-average precipitation across southern Europe.\n\nThe EA pattern exhibits very strong multi-decadal variability in the 1950-2004 record, with the negative phase prevailing during much of 1950-1976, and the positive phase occurring during much of 1977-2004. The positive phase of the EA pattern was particularly strong and persistent during 1997-2004, when 3-month running mean values routinely averaged 1.0-2.0 standard deviations above normal.",

The effects of this phenomenon are\r\ngenerally short-lived, and fishing is only slightly\r\ndisrupted. Occasionally (in 1891, 1925, 1941, 1957 - 58, 1965, 1972 -\r\n73, 1976, and 1982 - 83), the effects are major and prolonged. Under\r\nthese conditions, sea surface temperatures rise along the coast of\r\nPeru and in the equatorial eastern Pacific Ocean and may remain high\r\nfor more than a year, having disastrous effects on marine life and\r\nfishing. Excessive rainfall and flooding occur in the normally dry\r\ncoastal area of western tropical South America during these\r\nevents. Some oceanographers and meteorologists consider only the\r\nmajor, prolonged events as El Nino phenomena rather than the annually\r\noccurring weaker and short-lived ones.

In major warm events El Nino warming extends\r\nover much of the tropical Pacific and becomes clearly linked to the SO\r\npattern.

This pattern reflects large-scale changes in both the location and eastward extent of the Pacific jet stream, and also in the strength and position of the climatological mean Hudson Bay Low.

During winter and spring, the pattern consists of a north-south dipole of anomalies, with one center located over the Kamchatka Peninsula and another broad center of opposite sign covering portions of southeastern Asia and the low latitudes of the extreme western North Pacific. Therefore, strong positive or negative phases of this pattern reflect pronounced zonal and meridional variations in the location and intensity of the entrance region of the Pacific (or East Asian) jet steam. \n\nIn the summer and fall, the WP pattern becomes increasingly wave-like, and a third prominent center appears over Alaska and the Beaufort Sea, with a sign opposite to the center over the western North Pacific. This wave structure is most evident in the Fall, when it extends downstream along a quasi great-circle route into the western United States. The time series of the WP pattern indicates considerable intermonthly and interannual variability, and persistence of a particular phase of the pattern is relatively common.",

The temperature mean for that day was:\n\n( 90\u00b0F + 66\u00b0F ) / 2 = 78\u00b0F\n\nBecause the result is above 65\u00b0F:\n78\u00b0F - 65\u00b0F = 13 Cooling Degree Days\n\n\nExample 2: The high temperature for a particular day was 33\u00b0F and the low temperature was 25\u00b0F. The temperature mean for that day was:\n\n( 33\u00b0F + 25\u00b0F ) / 2 = 29\u00b0F\n\nBecause the result is below 65\u00b0F:\n\n65\u00b0F - 29\u00b0F = 36 Heating Degree Days.\n\nThe calculations shown in the two examples above are performed for each day of the year and the daily degree days are accumulated so that we can compare months and seasons.",

The cryosphere exerts an important influence on Earth\u2019s climate, owing to its high surface reflectivity (albedo). This property gives it the ability to reflect a large fraction of solar radiation back into space and influences how much solar energy is absorbed by land and oceans. Ice on land, in the form of ice sheets and glaciers, plays a further important role in the Earth system through its ability to store vast amounts of water away from the oceans for long periods of time. Any change in the ice volume stored on land, as ice sheets and glaciers grow or shrink, has a direct impact on global mean sea level. As the climate changes, the cryosphere changes with it and, through feedback processes, these changes have an influence on the climate. For example, the increased melting of snow and ice caused by a warming planet enables more solar energy to be absorbed by land or water, which in turn leads to more warming. This is also known as the snow- or ice-albedo feedback.",

Above the firnline, snow that falls each year packs down and changes into glacier ice as air is slowly forced out of it. This part of the glacier is its accumulation area where more snow falls each year than is lost by melting. Below the firnline is the ablation area, where melting predominates.",

The index was developed through consultation and collaboration with countries, institutions and experts across the globe. This index is designed to be used with economic and social vulnerability indices to provide insights into the processes that can negatively influence the sustainable development of countries.\n\nThe reason for using indices for this purpose is to provide a rapid and standardised method for characterising vulnerability in an overall sense, and identifying issues that may need to be addressed within each of the three pillars of sustainability, namely environmental, economic and social aspects of a country\u2019s development. Development is often achieved through trade-offs between these pillars. Therefore, in order to promote sustainability, it has become increasingly important to be able to measure how vulnerable each aspect is to damage and to identify ways of building resilience. With this information to hand, the outcome for countries could be optimised for their unique situations and development goals.",

Development of a vulnerability index for the environment which could be calculated on the scale of entire states for the purpose of ranking them and providing a single-figure expression of their relative environmental vulnerabilities. This work was done in response to a call made in the Barbados Plan of Action, the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) and an increasing awareness that small island developing states face disadvantages to their development associated with their remoteness, small size, dispersion, economic conditions, and limited natural resources. In the past vulnerability indices have been developed which describe the risks associated with economic and social conditions, climate change, sea-level rise, natural disasters and anthropogenic impacts. Most of these indices describe the vulnerability of human systems; there have been very limited attempts to describe effects on the environment. Human systems and the environment are dependent on one another so that risks to the environment of a state will eventually translate into risks to humans. This is the first attempt to construct an index that focuses on the vulnerability of the environment. An Environmental Vulnerability Index (the EVI) was constructed, based on a theoretical framework that identified three aspects of vulnerability: risks to the environment (natural and anthropogenic), the innate ability of the environment to cope with the risks (resilience) and ecosystem integrity (the health or condition of the environment as a result of past impacts). These three aspects correspond to three sub-indices, the REI, IRI and EDI, which are the Risk Exposure sub-Index, Intrinsic Resilience sub-Index and Environmental Degradation sub- Index respectively. The EVI was calculated as a weighted average of scores allocated in the range of 0-7 derived from a total of 57 indicators. A preliminary EVI was calculated for three countries, Australia, Fiji and Tuvalu. The preliminary EVI value for Tuvalu was the highest of the three countries indicating that its environment is the most vulnerable. The score obtained for Fiji was intermediate in value, and that for Australia was the lowest, though the difference between Fiji and Australia was relatively smaller than that between Fiji and Tuvalu. There were similar levels of risk in each of the countries, the most degradation in Australia and the least intrinsic resilience in Tuvalu. These results, though promising are only preliminary because the EVI requires refinement and there was insufficient time to collect all of the required data from all of the countries and because there were some inconsistencies in the quality of the data. We expect that each of these problems can be overcome. The EVI developed here will require further refinement before it becomes fully operational. The results show that it is possible to obtain a single figure measure of vulnerability and that data which were previously thought to be difficult to obtain can be obtained. The methodology selected in the computation of the index can produce results which could have operational usefulness for ranking countries according to their environmental vulnerabilities. It is envisaged that the EVI would be recalculated every 5 years to provide updates on the vulnerability status of countries. This index highlights the need for governments to upgrade their collection and collation of environmental statistics. In addition, the breakdown of results into meteorological, geological, anthropogenic, and other categories of risk highlights areas of concern for environmental action.",

Development of a vulnerability index for the environment which could be calculated on the scale of entire states for the purpose of ranking them and providing a single-figure expression of their relative environmental vulnerabilities. This work was done in response to a call made in the Barbados Plan of Action, the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) and an increasing awareness that small island developing states face disadvantages to their development associated with their remoteness, small size, dispersion, economic conditions, and limited natural resources. In the past vulnerability indices have been developed which describe the risks associated with economic and social conditions, climate change, sea-level rise, natural disasters and anthropogenic impacts. Most of these indices describe the vulnerability of human systems; there have been very limited attempts to describe effects on the environment. Human systems and the environment are dependent on one another so that risks to the environment of a state will eventually translate into risks to humans. This is the first attempt to construct an index that focuses on the vulnerability of the environment. An Environmental Vulnerability Index (the EVI) was constructed, based on a theoretical framework that identified three aspects of vulnerability: risks to the environment (natural and anthropogenic), the innate ability of the environment to cope with the risks (resilience) and ecosystem integrity (the health or condition of the environment as a result of past impacts). These three aspects correspond to three sub-indices, the REI, IRI and EDI, which are the Risk Exposure sub-Index, Intrinsic Resilience sub-Index and Environmental Degradation sub- Index respectively. The EVI was calculated as a weighted average of scores allocated in the range of 0-7 derived from a total of 57 indicators. A preliminary EVI was calculated for three countries, Australia, Fiji and Tuvalu. The preliminary EVI value for Tuvalu was the highest of the three countries indicating that its environment is the most vulnerable. The score obtained for Fiji was intermediate in value, and that for Australia was the lowest, though the difference between Fiji and Australia was relatively smaller than that between Fiji and Tuvalu. There were similar levels of risk in each of the countries, the most degradation in Australia and the least intrinsic resilience in Tuvalu. These results, though promising are only preliminary because the EVI requires refinement and there was insufficient time to collect all of the required data from all of the countries and because there were some inconsistencies in the quality of the data. We expect that each of these problems can be overcome. The EVI developed here will require further refinement before it becomes fully operational. The results show that it is possible to obtain a single figure measure of vulnerability and that data which were previously thought to be difficult to obtain can be obtained. The methodology selected in the computation of the index can produce results which could have operational usefulness for ranking countries according to their environmental vulnerabilities. It is envisaged that the EVI would be recalculated every 5 years to provide updates on the vulnerability status of countries. This index highlights the need for governments to upgrade their collection and collation of environmental statistics. In addition, the breakdown of results into meteorological, geological, anthropogenic, and other categories of risk highlights areas of concern for environmental action.",

It has become the semi-official drought index.\nThe Palmer Index is most effective in determining long term drought\u00bfa matter of several months\u00bfand is not as good with short-term forecasts (a matter of weeks). It uses a 0 as normal, and drought is shown in terms of minus numbers; for example, minus 2 is moderate drought, minus 3 is severe drought, and minus\n4 is extreme drought. The Crop Moisture Index (CMI) is also a formula that was developed by Wayne Palmer subsequent to his development of the Palmer Drought Index. The CMI responds more rapidly than the Palmer Index and can change considerably from week to week, so it is more effective in calculating\nshort-term abnormal dryness or wetness affecting agriculture. CMI is designed to indicate normal conditions at the beginning and end of the growing season; it uses the same levels as the Palmer Drought Index. It differs from the Palmer Index in that the formula places less weight on the data from previous weeks and more weight on the recent week.",

Beyond the tree line, they are unable to grow because of inappropriate environmental conditions (usually cold temperatures or lack of moisture).[1]:51 Some distinguish additionally a deeper timberline or forest line, where trees form a forest with a closed canopy.[2]:151\n\nAt the tree line, tree growth is often very stunted, with the last trees forming low, densely matted bushes. If it is caused by wind, it is known as krummholz formation, from the German for 'twisted wood'.[3]:58\n\nThe tree line, like many other natural lines (lake boundaries, for example), appears well-defined from a distance, but upon sufficiently close inspection, it is a gradual transition in most places. Trees grow shorter towards the inhospitable climate until they simply stop growing.[3]:55",

Be10 is produced in the atmosphere by cosmic ray collisions with atoms of oxygen and nitrogen. Beryllium 10 concentrations are linked to cosmic ray intensity which can be a proxy for solar strength.\n\nOne way to capture earth's record of that proxy data is to drill deep ice cores. Greenland, due to having a large and relatively stable deep ice sheet is often the target for drilling ice cores.\n\nIsotopic analysis of the ice in the core can be linked to temperature and global sea level variations. Analysis of the air contained in bubbles in the ice can reveal the palaeocomposition of the atmosphere, in particular CO2 variations. Volcanic eruptions leave identifiable ash layers.\n\nWhile it sounds simple to analyze, there are issues of ice compression, flow, and other factors that must be taken into consideration when doing reconstructions from such data. I attended a talk at ICCC 09 that showed one of the ice core operations had procedures that left significant contamination issues for CO2. But since Beryllium is rather rare, it doesn't seem to have the same contamination issues attached.",

Atmospheric CO2 has increased about 25 percent since the early 1800s, with an estimated increase of 10 percent since 1958 (burning fossil fuels is the leading cause of increased CO2, deforestation the second\nmajor cause). The increased amounts of CO2 in the atmosphere enhance the greenhouse effect, blocking heat from escaping into space and contributing to the warming of Earth's lower atmosphere. (Earth Observatory) The most direct method for measuring atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations\nfor periods before direct sampling is to measure bubbles of air (fluid or gas inclusions) trapped in the Antarctic or Greenland ice caps. The most widely accepted of such studies come from a variety of Antarctic cores and indicate that atmospheric CO2 levels were about 260\u00bf280uL/L immediately before\nindustrial emissions began and did not vary much from this level during the preceding 10,000 years.\nThe longest ice core record comes from Vostok, Antarctica, where ice has been sampled to a depth of 3,600 meters, corresponding to an age of 420,000 years before the present. During this time, the atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration has varied between 180\u00bf210 uL/L during ice ages, increasing to\n280\u00bf300 uL/L during warmer interglacials.(http://www.nationmaster.com/encyclopedia/Carbon-dioxide)",

Depending on the temperature of evaporation and how far the water has had to travel before it fell as snow, the ratio of 18O to 16O will vary. This ratio, known as d18O, can be measured very accurately using a mass spectrometer. Over short time scales the change in temperature from summer to winter produces a very clear oscillation in the 18O/16O ratio. This oscillation is used to determine the age of the core at different depths, simply by counting the oscillations. Over longer time periods, this ratio indicates the average temperature of the regions between the evaporation site and the coring site. Investigators in Greenland and Antarctica are also analyzing for the ratio of 1H/2H (Hydrogen to deuterium) which will allow even finer detail about source temperature and condensation history to be obtained.",

The amount of growth is an indicator of how much ground water dripped into the cave. Little growth might indicate a drought, just as rapid growth could point to heavy precipitation. When the speleothems stop growing, the outside becomes dirty and eroded in places, giving it a dull appearance. Spelothems can be dated by measuring how much uranium has decayed. Evidence of past climate changes can be inferred from measuring oxygen isotopes in speleothems.",

These data sources describe fire regimes at multiple temporal and spatial scales. Tree-ring data provide temporally precise, short-term reconstructions of fire events, usually spanning the last 400 years or less. By carefully crossdating and examining the tree rings, the exact year and often even the season in which the fire occurred can be determined. These data offer a high level of spatial resolution in a fire reconstruction in that the location of fire-scarred trees identifies the exact location of particular fires. Although tree-ring methods extend back to the age of the oldest living tree, the records attenuate back through time as older trees are less abundant.",

Because charcoal particles can be carried aloft to great heights and transported great distances, the source of the charcoal may be from distant fires as well as local fires. Charcoal accumulation may continue for a few years after a fire because of transportation and redeposition of secondary charcoal. This process tends to blur the exact age of a fire, even when the charcoal particles are directly dated by radiocarbon dating, which itself has a dating precision of +/- 5%. Additionally, the charcoal deposited may represent more than one fire within the area, or fires from more than one year. As a result, fire episodes are referred to as one or more fires occurring in the time interval of interest, rather than individual fires.",

The production of O18 is highly dependent on temperature. The oxygen isotope record in marine sediments varies locally with temperature and globally with variations in continental ice volume. Oxygen isotope analyses have been carried out on deep sea cores from areas of calcareous sedimentation throughout the world and similar variations in O18 are recorded everywhere. The O18 signal is that of ice volume changes on the continents and concomitant changes in the isotopic content of the oceans.",

Sea water contains many isotopes of oxygen, the most common being 18O to 16O. During cold periods the glaciers grow, water is drawn up into them, and the proportion of 18O increases. When the ice-caps melt during periods of warm climate the proportion of 18O decreases. There are two ways of obtaining data about the 16O to 18O ratio, both using measurements made using a mass spectrometer. The first is to use cores from the polar ice-caps which preserve layers of snow ultimately made from sea water. The second is to use the skeletons of foraminifera preserved in ocean-bottom ooze because these marine fossils had the same 16O to 18O ratio as the sea water during the time they were alive. Using this data a series of at least eleven cycles of cooling and warming climatic conditions have been recognized in the northern hemisphere during the Pleistocene.",

For the case of a change in solar irradiance (i.e., \"solar forcing\"), the radiative forcing is simply the change in the average amount of solar energy absorbed per square meter of the Earth's area. Since the cross-sectional area of the Earth exposed to the sun (\u03c0r2) is equal to 1/4 of the surface area of the Earth (4\u03c0r2), the solar input per unit area is one quarter the change in solar intensity. This must be multiplied by the fraction of incident sunlight that is absorbed, F=(1-R), where R is the reflectivity, or albedo, of the Earth, equal to approximately 0.7. Thus, the solar forcing is the change in the solar intensity divided by 4 and multiplied by 0.7.",

Whilst a long-term natural process, it may be exacerbated by global warming. This results in a positive feedback effect, as methane is itself a powerful greenhouse gas. The feedback of the undisturbed process is comparably weak, however, because the local release leads to a warming spread over the whole globe.\n\nThe Arctic region is one of the many natural sources of the greenhouse gas methane.[1] Global warming may accelerate its release, due to both release of methane from existing stores, and from methanogenesis in rotting biomass.[2] Large quantities of methane are stored in the Arctic in natural gas deposits, permafrost, and as submarine clathrates. Permafrost and clathrates degrade on warming, thus large releases of methane from these sources may arise as a result of global warming.[3][4] Other sources of methane include submarine taliks, river transport, ice complex retreat, submarine permafrost and decaying gas hydrate deposits.[5]",

It also exists below ground as groundwater, in wells and aquifers. Water vapor is most visible as clouds and fog.\n\nThe frozen part of Earth's hydrosphere is made of ice: glaciers, ice caps and icebergs. The frozen part of the hydrosphere has its own name, the cryosphere. \n\nWater moves through the hydrosphere in a cycle. Water collects in clouds, then falls to Earth in the form of rain or snow. This water collects in rivers, lakes and oceans. Then it evaporates into the atmosphere to start the cycle all over again. This is called the water cycle.",

Concentration is a unitless term that describes the relative amount of area covered by ice, compared to some reference area. Thus, concentration describes how much of a 25.0 kilometer by 25.0 kilometer (15.5 mile by 15.5 mile) box is covered by sea ice. Ice concentration typically is reported as a percentage (0 to 100 percent ice), a fraction from 0 to 1, or sometimes in tenths (0/10 to 10/10). Our Sea Ice Index products show ice concentration as a percentage. A value of 0 means there is no ice, while a value of 100 means the region is completely covered by ice.",

Units of measure are watts per square meter (W/m2). Radiative forcing is calculated by the difference between the net (downward minus upward) radiative fluxes (irradiance) with and without LAP across a portion of the visible spectrum, for example from 0.350 to 0.876 um. This value depends on the amount of dust or soot, particle size distribution, and the amount of incoming solar radiation.",

Most, but not all, methods seek to either (a) reduce the amount of absorbed solar energy in the climate system (Solar Radiation Management) or (b) increase net carbon sinks from the atmosphere at a scale sufficiently large to alter climate (Carbon Dioxide Removal). Scale and intent are of central importance. Two key characteristics of geoengineering methods of particular concern are that they use or affect the climate system (e.g., atmosphere, land, or ocean) globally or regionally and/or could have substantive unintended effects that cross national boundaries. Geoengineering is different from weather modification and ecological engineering, but the boundary can be fuzzy.",

The rock compacts because the water is partly responsible for holding the ground up. When the water is withdrawn, the rocks falls in on itself. You may not notice land subsidence too much because it can occur over large areas rather than in a small spot, like a sinkhole. That doesn't mean that subsidence is not a big event -- states like California, Texas, and Florida have suffered damage to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars over the years.",

Other names such as brush fire, bushfire, forest fire, desert fire, grass fire, hill fire, peat fire, vegetation fire, and veldfire may be used to describe the same phenomenon depending on the type of vegetation being burned. A wildfire differs from other fires by its extensive size, the speed at which it can spread out from its original source, its potential to change direction unexpectedly, and its ability to jump gaps such as roads, rivers and fire breaks. Wildfires are characterized in terms of the cause of ignition, their physical properties such as speed of propagation, the combustible material present, and the effect of weather on the fire.",

Wildfire suppression also addresses the issues of the wildland-urban interface, where populated areas border with wildland areas.",

As rocks are transported downstream along a riverbed (by a mixture of rolling, sliding and saltating), the regular impacts between them cause them to be broken up into smaller fragments.

Oxygen remains as an O2 molecule, whether it's in its gas phase or in solution, but when CO2 is dissolved in water, a small proportion of it reacts chemically with H2O to form carbonic acid, H2CO3. (There's no mystery about that: just add up the six atoms.) In water carbonic acid dissociates rapidly to form a H+ ion and HCO2 (bicarbonate), so it affects the carbonate equilibrium, and pH values change as a result.\n \nDissolved CO2 lowers the average pH of rainwater to 5.7, even where \"acid rain\" caused by pollution isn't a factor. The gentle acidity of rainwater is a major source for the weathering of minerals, which the carbonic acid leaches from rocks and which eventually find their way to the ocean.",

They are found along the seaward margin of most\r\nabyssal plains and originate from the spreading of mid-ocean ridges. As such,\r\nthey usually form two strips parallel to mid-ocean ridges. They generally\r\ndecrease in height as one traverses away from the ridges as they gradually\r\nbecome covered with sediment and are replaced by abyssal plains.\r\nABYSSAL PLAINS: Flat areas of the ocean basin floor which slope less than 1\r\npart in 1000. These were formed by turbidity currents which covered the\r\npreexisting topography. Most abyssal plains are located between the base of the\ncontinental rise and the abyssal hills. The remainder are trench abyssal plains\nthat lie in the bottom of deep-sea trenches. This latter type traps all\r\nsediment from turbidity currents and prevents abyssal plains from forming\r\nfurther seaward, e.g. much of the Pacific Ocean floor.",

Most organisms avoid, or\nbecome physiologically stressed, in waters with oxygen below this\nconcentration. Also known as a dead zone, hypoxia can also kill marine\norganisms which cannot escape the low-oxygen water, affecting commercial\nharvests and the health of impacted ecosystems.\n3. Rationale: Numerous researchers are studying hypoxia, the hypoxic\nzone, and its effect on fisheries. It is becoming a highly visible hot\ntopic in the Gulf of Mexico and other regions as the onset of hypoxia is\nlargely due to increased nutrient run off from agriculture practices in the\nMississippi River watershed. I think there needs to be a unifying keyword\nto link these datasets together for users to discover hypoxia related data\nacross multiple organizations and programs.",

The mesoscale eddy field includes coherent vortices, as well as a rich cascade of other structures such as filaments, squirts and spirals. The mesoscale field is characterized by temperature and salinity anomalies with associated flow anomalies that are nearly in geostrophic balance. Although only the surface expression of mesoscale eddies is visible in satellite images of sea surface height or temperature, they are in fact three dimensional structures that reach down into the pycnocline. A special class of eddies, known as meddies (Mediterranean eddies), are predominantly sub-surface lenses of salty water that form off the Atlantic coast of Spain/Portugal from the deep Mediterranean outflow.",

However, compared to mesoscale eddies, they remain poorly studied due to technical difficulties in observing these small-scale and ephemeral ocean features. Satellite altimeters typically cannot characterize eddies smaller than 100\u2013200 km in diameter. In subtropical and tropical oceans sea surface temperature imagery lose their spatial contrast during summer, and satellite ocean color imagery also suffer to lack of sufficient observations due to clouds, strong sun glint, and stray light (Chen et al., 2019; Hu, 2011). As a result, to date, there is generally a lack of synoptic and long-term characterization of submesoscale eddies in the world's oceans, except perhaps in some small regions when continuous land-based high frequency-radar observations are available.",

                                                    "description": "The sea surface foundation temperature is the water temperature that is not influenced by a thermally stratified layer of diurnal temperature variability (either by daytime warming or nocturnal cooling). The foundation temperature is named to indicate that it is the temperature from which the growth of the diurnal thermocline develops each day, noting that on some occasions with a deep mixed layer there is no clear foundation temperature in the surface layer. In general, sea surface foundation temperature will be similar to a night time minimum or pre-dawn value at depths of between approximately 1 and 5 meters. In the absence of any diurnal signal, the foundation temperature is considered equivalent to the quantity with standard name sea_surface_subskin_temperature. The sea surface foundation temperature defines a level in the upper water column that varies in depth, space, and time depending on the local balance between thermal stratification and turbulent energy and is expected to change slowly over the course of a day. If possible, a data variable with the standard name sea_surface_foundation_temperature should be used with a scalar vertical coordinate variable to specify the depth of the foundation level. Sea surface foundation temperature is measured at the base of the diurnal thermocline or as close to the water surface as possible in the absence of thermal stratification. Only in situ contact thermometry is able to measure the sea surface foundation temperature. Analysis procedures must be used to estimate sea surface foundation temperature value from radiometric satellite measurements of the quantities with standard names sea_surface_skin_temperature and sea_surface_subskin_temperature. Sea surface foundation temperature provides a connection with the historical concept of a \"bulk\" sea surface temperature considered representative of the oceanic mixed layer temperature that is typically represented by any sea temperature measurement within the upper ocean over a depth range of 1 to approximately 20 meters. The general term, \"bulk\" sea surface temperature, has the standard name sea_surface_temperature with no associated vertical coordinate axis. Sea surface foundation temperature provides a more precise, well defined quantity than \"bulk\" sea surface temperature and, consequently, is more representative of the mixed layer temperature. The temperature of sea water at a particular depth (other than the foundation level) should be reported using the standard name sea_water_temperature and, wherever possible, supplying a vertical coordinate axis or scalar coordinate variable.",

Sea salt aerosols are characterized as non-light-absorbing, highly hygroscopic, and having coarse particle size. Some sea salt dominated aerosols could have a single scattering albedo as large as ~0.97. Due to the hygroscopy, a sea salt particle can serve as a very efficient cloud condensation nuclei (CCN), altering cloud reflectivity, lifetime, and precipitation process. According to the IPCC report, the total sea salt flux from ocean to atmosphere is ~3300 Tg/yr",

Over short time scales the change in temperature from\nsummer to winter produces a very clear oscillation in the 18O/16O ratio. This\noscillation is used to determine the age of the core at different depths,\nsimply by counting the oscillations. Over longer time periods, this ratio\nindicates the average temperature of the regions between the evaporation site\nand the coring site.

Interpretation of this record reveals a diverse array of environmental signatures that include the documentation of anthropogenically derived pollutants, volcanic and biomass burning events, storminess over marine surfaces, continental aridity and biogenic source strength plus information related to the controls on both high- and low-frequency climate events of the last 110,000 years. Climate forcings investigated include changes in insolation of the order of the major orbital cycles that control the long-term behavior of atmospheric circulation patterns through changes in ice volume (sea level), events such as the Heinrich events (massive discharges of icebergs first identified in t he marine record) that are found to operate on a 6100-year cycle due largely to the lagged response of ice sheets to changes in insolation and consequent glacier dynamics, and rapid climate change events (massive reorganizations of atmospheric circulation) that are demonstrated to operate on 1450-year cycles. Changes in insolation and associated positive feedbacks related to ice sheets may assist in explaining favorable time periods and controls on the amplitude of massive rapid climate change events. Explanation for the exact timing and global synchroneity of these events is, however, more complicated. Preliminary evidence points to possible solar variability-climate associations for these events and perhaps others that are embedded in our ice-core-derived atmospheric circulation records.",

For example, fossils of bacteria, foraminifera, diatoms, very small invertebrate shells or skeletons, pollen, and tiny bones and teeth of large vertebrates, among others, can be called microfossils. But it is an unnatural grouping. Nevertheless, this utilitarian subdivision of paleontology, first recognized in 1883, is very significant in geology, paleontology, and biology. \n\nMicrofossils have many applications to petroleum geology (Fleisher and Lane, in press, Ventress, 1991, LeRoy, 1977). The two most common uses are: biostratigraphy and paleoenvironmental analyses. Biostratigraphy is the differentiation of rock units based upon the fossils which they contain. Paleoenvironmental analysis is the interpretation of the depositional environment in which the rock unit formed, based upon the fossils found within the unit. There are many other uses of fossils besides these, including: paleoclimatology, biogeography, and thermal maturation.",

The details of decomposition processes are generally not well defined, as a molecule may break up into a host of smaller fragments. Chemical decomposition is exploited in several analytical techniques, notably mass spectrometry, traditional gravimetric analysis, and thermogravimetric analysis.",

Rongowai will test a new version of the sensors used on the CyGNSS satellites, which include additional signal frequencies and will incorporate Galileo (E.U.) GNSS satellites in addition to GPS. By taking the novel approach of mounting this next-generation GNSS-R receiver on a commercial Air New Zealand aircraft, Rongowai allows for an unprecedented collection of climate data over and around the islands of New Zealand. This data will include inundation and coastal dynamics, and soil moisture content and variability.",

Currently, the global SLR network tracks over forty such satellites. The observable is the round-trip laser pulse time-of-flight to the satellite.\n\nSLR and Lunar Laser Ranging (LLR) use short-pulse lasers and state-of-the-art optical receivers and timing electronics to measure the two-way time of flight (and hence distance) from ground stations to retroreflector arrays on Earth orbiting satellites and the Moon.\n\nSLR and Lunar Laser Ranging (LLR) use short-pulse lasers and state-of-the-art optical receivers and timing electronics to measure the two-way time of flight (and hence distance) from ground stations to retroreflector arrays on Earth orbiting satellites and the moon. The laser stations are also used to measure one-way distance from the ground stations to remote optical receivers on space and for very accurate time-transfer. Laser ranging activities are organized under the ILRS.\n\nSLR is an accurate technique for determining the geocentric position of an Earth satellite, allowing for the precise calibration of radar altimeters and separation of long-term instrumentation drift from secular changes in ocean topography. SLR\u2019s ability to measure the temporal variations in the Earth\u2019s gravity field and to monitor motion of a global network of stations with respect to the geocenter, together with the capability to monitor vertical motion in an absolute system, makes it unique for modeling and evaluating long-term climate change.",

Using large numbers of time difference measurements from many quasars observed with a global network of antennas, VLBI determines the inertial reference frame defined by the quasars and simultaneously the precise positions of the antennas. Because the time difference measurements are precise to a few picoseconds, VLBI determines the relative positions of the antennas to a few millimeters and the quasar positions to fractions of a milliarcsecond. Since the antennas are fixed to the Earth, their locations track the instantaneous orientation of the Earth in the inertial reference frame.\n\nThe celestial reference frame is defined by VLBI. The International Astronomical Union has adopted over 3,400 extragalactic radio sources (mostly quasars) used by VLBI as the defining objects of the celestial reference frame. Extragalactic objects form a true inertial reference frame because they are at such great distances that their motions across the sky are undetectable. Positions of stars in our galaxy are now tied to this reference frame, and this is the same reference frame used for measuring Earth orientation. VLBI is unique in its ability to make rapid, accurate measurements of the orientation of the terrestrial reference frame with respect to the celestial reference frame.\n\nVLBI observations are sponsored by over 40 organizations located in 19 countries. VLBI determines with unequaled accuracy the terrestrial reference frame (antenna locations on the Earth), the celestial reference frame (quasar positions on the sky), and Earth's orientation in space.",

Ideally, It is the total range of deviation at an instant of time from quiet day values of the horizontal magnetic field (h) around the auroral oval. Defined and developed by Davis and Sugiura [1966], AE has been usefully employed both qualitatively and quantitatively as a correlative index in studies of substorm morphology, the behavior of communication satellites, radio propagation, radio scintillation, and the coupling between the interplanetary magnetic field and the earth's magnetosphere. For these varied uses, AE possesses advantages over other geomagnetic indices or at least shares their advantageous properties.",

Glacial striations are usually multiple, straight, and parallel, representing the movement of the glacier using rock fragments and sand grains, embedded in the base of the glacier, as cutting tools. Large amounts of coarse gravel and boulders carried along underneath the glacier provide the abrasive power to cut trough-like glacial grooves, and finer sediments also in the base of the moving glacier further scour and polish the bedrock surface, forming a glacial pavement.",

Oxygen remains as an O2 molecule, whether it's in its gas phase or in solution, but when CO2 is dissolved in water, a small proportion of it reacts chemically with H2O to form carbonic acid, H2CO3. (There's no mystery about that: just add up the six atoms.) In water carbonic acid dissociates rapidly to form a H+ ion and HCO2 (bicarbonate), so it affects the carbonate equilibrium, and pH values change as a result.\n \nDissolved CO2 lowers the average pH of rainwater to 5.7, even where \"acid rain\" caused by pollution isn't a factor. The gentle acidity of rainwater is a major source for the weathering of minerals, which the carbonic acid leaches from rocks and which eventually find their way to the ocean.",

Because gravity changes over the surface of the Earth, the weight of an object changes along with it. One can define standard gravity as the value of gravity for a perfectly smooth 'idealized' Earth, and the gravity 'anomaly' is a measure of how actual gravity deviates from this standard. A map of gravity anomalies (usually expressed in units of milliGals) tends to highlight short wavelength features better than a map of the geoid.",

Very high algal growth that stays suspended in a water body can almost totally block light penetration as well as use up the dissolved oxygen in the water body, causing a eutrophic condition that can drastically reduce all life in the water body.",

The approach for development was three-fold: (1) Select guidelines from the World Health Organization that are appropriate in assessing global water quality for human health, (2) Select variables from GEMStat that have an appropriate guideline and reasonable global coverage, and (3) determine, on an annual basis, an overall index rating for each station using the water quality index equation endorsed by the Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment. The index allowed measurements of the frequency and extent to which variables exceeded their respective WHO guidelines, at each individual monitoring station included within GEMStat, allowing both spatial and temporal assessment of global water quality. Development of the index was followed by preliminary sensitivity analysis and verification of the index against real water quality data.",

AOGCMs can be used for the prediction and rate of change of\nfuture climate. They are also used to study the variability and physical\nprocesses of the coupled climate system. Global climate models typically have a\nresolution of a few hundred kilometres. Climate projections from the Hadley\nCentre make use of the HadCM2 AOGCM, developed in 1994, and its successor\nHadCM3 AOGCM, developed in 1998. Greenhouse-gas experiments with AOGCMs have\nusually been driven by specifying atmospheric concentrations of the gases, but\nif a carbon cycle model is included, the AOGCM can predict changes in carbon\ndioxide concentration, given the emissions of carbon dioxide into the\natmosphere. Similarly, an AOGCM coupled to an atmospheric chemistry model is\nable to predict the changes in concentration of other atmospheric constituents\nin response to climate change and to the changing emissions of various gases.\nFurther information is available on: some aspects of ocean simulation in HadCM3\n(thermohaline circulation, ventilation, vertical mixing), decadal variability\nin the ocean of HadCM3.\r\nRecently a global coupled climate model with an eddy-permitting ocean\nresolution has been developed at the Hadley Centre, in order to better\nrepresent important oceanic processes.",

                                    "description": "Glacio-hydrological models (GHMs) allow us to develop an understanding of how future climate change will affect river flow regimes in glaciated watersheds. A variety of simplified GHM structures and parameterisations exist, yet the performance of these are rarely quantified at the process level or with metrics beyond global summary statistics. A fuller understanding of the deficiencies in competing model structures and parameterisations and the ability of models to simulate physical processes require performance metrics utilising the full range of uncertainty information within input observations. Here, the glacio-hydrological characteristics of the Virkis\u00e1 River basin in southern Iceland are characterised using 33 signatures derived from observations of ice melt, snow coverage and river discharge. The uncertainty of each set of observations is harnessed to define the limits of acceptability (LOA), a set of criteria used to objectively evaluate the acceptability of different GHM structures and parameterisations. This framework is used to compare and diagnose deficiencies in three melt and three run-off-routing model structures. Increased model complexity is shown to improve acceptability when evaluated against specific signatures but does not always result in better consistency across all signatures, emphasising the difficulty in appropriate model selection and the need for multi-model prediction approaches to account for model selection uncertainty. Melt and run-off-routing structures demonstrate a hierarchy of influence on river discharge signatures with melt model structure having the most influence on discharge hydrograph seasonality and run-off-routing structure on shorter-timescale discharge events. None of the tested GHM structural configurations returned acceptable simulations across the full population of signatures. The framework outlined here provides a comprehensive and rigorous assessment tool for evaluating the acceptability of different GHM process hypotheses. Future melt and run-off model forecasts should seek to diagnose structural model deficiencies and evaluate diagnostic signatures of system behaviour using a LOA framework.",

They are used to gain ecological and evolutionary insights and to predict distributions across landscapes, sometimes requiring extrapolation in space and time. SDMs are now widely used across terrestrial, freshwater, and marine realms. Differences in methods between disciplines reflect both differences in species mobility and in \u201cestablished use.\u201d Model realism and robustness is influenced by selection of relevant predictors and modeling method, consideration of scale, how the interplay between environmental and geographic factors is handled, and the extent of extrapolation. Current linkages between SDM practice and ecological theory are often weak, hindering progress. Remaining challenges include: improvement of methods for modeling presence-only data and for model selection and evaluation; accounting for biotic interactions; and assessing model uncertainty.",

WPS can describe any calculation (i.e. process) including all of its inputs and outputs, and trigger its execution as a Web Service. WPS supports simultaneous exposure of processes via HTTP GET, HTTP POST, and SOAP, thus allowing the client to choose the most appropriate interface mechanism. The specific processes served up by a WPS implementation are defined by the owner of that implementation. Although WPS was designed to work with spatially referenced data, it can be used with any kind of data.",
